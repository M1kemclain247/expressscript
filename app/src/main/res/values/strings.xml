        Studies show that eating a proper breakfast is one of the most positive things you
        can do if you are trying to lose weight. Breakfast skippers tend to gain weight.
        A balanced breakfast includes fresh fruit or fruit juice, a high-fibre breakfast cereal,
        low-fat milk or yoghurt, wholewheat toast, and a boiled egg.  </string>
